Neural Networks available in the Clarion ibrary

HopfieldNetwork
    - neural network to store and retrieve memory like the human brain
    - a neuron either is on (firing) or is off (not firing), a vast
      simplification of the real situation

QBPNetwork (Q-learning with backpropagation neural network)

SimplifiedQBPNetwork (simplified version of QBNetwork)

BPNetwork (a 3-layer backpropagation neural network)
    - Backpropagation is the essence of neural network training. It is the method
      of fine-tuning the weights of a neural network based on the error rate obtained
      in the previous epoch (i.e., iteration). Proper tuning of the weights allows
      you to reduce error rates and make the model reliable by increasing its generalization.
